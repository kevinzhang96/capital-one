# [fit] Yeah, I don't care...

# _**Barriers to Entry**_
- Mac (Yosemite or later)
- Swift (now up to 2.2)
- Xcode (now up to 7.3.1)
- iOS frameworks (e.g. UIKit)
- $99/year to run your app on a device/submit to App Store

## [fit] Just Kidding... It's Getting Better!
- $99 is now _only_ required for App Store submission
- The Equalizer -- the _**Swift**_ transition
	- Released at WWDC June, 2014 (watchOS, tvOS)
	- Simpler, more concise, safer, AND more fun!

## [fit] _**MVC**_
- _Model:_ encapsulate the data specific to an app
- _ViewControllers:_ contain the “glue” code between views and models
- _Views:_ are parts of the app that users can see

- Scene == View == Screen
	- Has subviews (buttons, labels, text, etc)
- Tied to an instance of a _UIViewController_
