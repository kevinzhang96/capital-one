# react101

Welcome to React 101. Please complete the pre-work before the in-person event. It's called [reversed classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) and it will allow us to focus on the more advanced topics during the in-person event.

1. Download the slides from react-c1.md or react-c1.pdf
2. Watch videos while coding along. The videos are in the `videos` folder
3. Download and complete the self-paced workshop: https://github.com/kohei-takata/learnyoureact
4. Finish the Timer project which is described in the slides and last video.


**UPDATE**: There is a mistake in version in videos (corrected in slides). Use Babel v 5.8.34 for browser JSX compilation (development only), and `babel-cli` v 6.5.0 and `babel-preset-react` v6.5.0 for JSX pre-processing (recommended for production).
